The "ESP32Cam Face Recognition Telegram" project uses the ESP32-CAM's built-in facial recognition to capture and process images. When a face is recognized, the ESP32 sends notifications or images to a Telegram bot. This system is ideal for real-time alerts in security or access control applications.
